I have included the .NET dlls for ADAL and placed them in this folder.

The download link can be found on Nuget:
https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/2.28.3

Note: We specifically use ADAL v2 here.

You can extract the contents of the .nupkg with a File Extractor like 7z, WinZip, etc...

I extracted the contents from \lib\net45\ and copied them here.
